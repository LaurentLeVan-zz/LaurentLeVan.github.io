Hello everyones !
Today, I decided to make a little biography about me !

I was born in 1994 in Perpignan, a City in the south of France. 
Son of an Artist painter, I like drawing since my childhood.
I practiced Viet Vo Dao, a Vietnamese martial art, for several years. For me, it's a link with my origins.
Indeed, my parents are Vietnamese. Due to them, I have a double culture, and enjoy travelling.
In 2012, I got my General Baccalaureate in Science with honours.
Then, attracted by new technologies, I decided to study Computer Science in Montpellier and obtained my Technology degree in 2014.
Since september 2014, I study at Imerir a school in Computer Science & Robotic based in Perpignan.
And I will obtain my diploma of "Project manager in Computer Science and Robotic" (Master degree level) in 2017.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading news about Tech trends and watch TV series. I also enjoy biking and running during sunny days.

In september I will spend a Semester in Finland, but I will say more about it in another post.
